This is a calculator I built to the specifications of the odin project.
Features:
-Enables the user to add, subtract, multiply, and divide
-Keyboard entry is allowed
-Operations can be chained (eg 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = 42)
-Decimals are allowed and limited to 5 spaces
-There is a backspace button to correct errors

There are no dependencies
