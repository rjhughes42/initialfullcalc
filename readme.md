This is a calculator I built to the specifications of the odin project.
<ul>
Features:
  <li>Enables the user to add, subtract, multiply, and divide</li>
<li>Keyboard entry is allowed</li>
<li>Operations can be chained (eg 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = 42)</li>
<li>Decimals are allowed and limited to 5 spaces</li>
<li>There is a backspace button to correct errors</li>
</ul>
There are no dependencies
